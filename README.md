# Text-Mining-Yelp-Reviews-2018
The purpose of this project is to compare results in classification of sentiment on Yelp Reviews using two different approaches in text mining. The first approach used is the standard machine learning TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) matrix technique. The text is normalized utilizing case conversions, and removing of special characters and stopwords. A TF-IDF sparse matrix is then constructed with a true label column (positive, negative) and random forest used on the matrix to classify reviews. The second approach is using a dictionary-based Parsimonious Rule-Based Model for Sentiment Analysis (VADER package). These two methods are also performed on Video Game review data in an effort to assess the uniformity of application of the Rule-Based Model.

The data files are too large for storage on github. In order to run the code, please inquire further by contacting me.
